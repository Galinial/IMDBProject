This project is an IMDB App build with TCA + SwiftUI

Instructions:
1. to add a movie or a tv show to your favorite list, you may press the star icon below the poster in the media item details view.
2. i used my account id on IMDB for the favorite GET + POST request, so you will have some favorite items already, unless you put your on account id
3. my app currently support only for the first page for the favorites list, so you could add up to 20 items to your favorite list max (the GET response is up to 20 items).

please contact me if there is any questions.
